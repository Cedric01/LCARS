# LCARS

The LCARS project is a dashboard system for anyone who needs an interesting looking interface for their metrics.

The project is designed primarily for a software development team, but could easily be adapted for other purposes.

You need a few JSON files in App_Data that aren't in the repo in order to get the project running.

The required files are generated the first time the solution runs (it checks for the existence of the core Settings.json file and will run if it isn't there).

You must edit these immediately to suit your environment. If you don't select a particular screen type in the Admin area, you can skip its config.
